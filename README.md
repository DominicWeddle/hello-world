# hello-world
My first repository! :)

Hello my fellow coders, this is just a little bit about myself. I study coding as education, hobbies, and a way of life. My two languages that I am most fond with is Python and Java. I code on games like Minecraft and Skyrim. I do other coding jobs for others and in my spare time I debug and create my own code and plugins. If you took the time to read this, I thank you, and happy coding!

My favorite foods: Tacos, Steak, Burgers (I know I sound fat XD), and I love Mtn. Dew, Dorito's, and Reese's.
